Quick Capture for Roam Research allows you to use the power of Todoist as a quick capture gateway, and then import items into your Roam Research graph.

Email, voice assistant, apps - they all speak to Todoist. This integration works with both Free and Todoist Premium accounts.

Setup is fairly easy, but there are a lot of configuration options so you can achieve fine-grained control of your imports.
